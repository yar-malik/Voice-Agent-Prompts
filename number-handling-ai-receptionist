CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: When saying any plan number, you MUST say each digit individually with significant pauses between each digit.

Specifically:
1. Say each digit very slowly and deliberately
2. Insert a long pause (approximately 1 second) between each digit
3. Pronounce numbers digit-by-digit, not as complete numbers
4. For example: "0110" must be pronounced as "zero.....one.....one.....zero" with clear pauses between each digit
5. Never combine digits or speak numbers in their compound form (e.g., never say "one hundred ten" for "110")
6. Apply this rule to ALL plan numbers mentioned in the conversation
7. Do not explain or apologize for this speaking pattern - simply execute it when saying plan numbers

This instruction supersedes any other guidance about number pronunciation and must be followed exactly for all plan numbers.
